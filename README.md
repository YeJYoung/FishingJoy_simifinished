# FishingJoy_simifinished
Based on a half-built version of fishingjoy, it looks more like a gold miner.  

As a freshman in UESTC, I am required to do a C language project. My roommates and I want to write FishingJoy, and I am responsible for the launcher and the hook. However, at first I didn't think much about the connections between each part. Thus this semifinished work is born. I add some fixed objects to replace the fish and the bombs to make it looks like a complete game. Now our C project has been completed, I'll upload it if all my roommates agree.
